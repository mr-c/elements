# Antha Academy - A Directory of Tutorials to help you learn Antha

This directory contains lessons meant to teach the user the basics of the Antha Environment. 
It holds both workflows and elements.

## Pre-requisites

### Installation
To for instructions on how to install Antha  please see the instructions on the antha-lang website. For those new to coding you can [install a pre-configured Antha Virtual Machince (AnthaVM)](http://www.antha-lang.org/academy/install/quickinstall/index.html). On a mac you can also [install natively following these instructions](http://www.antha-lang.org/academy/install/advancedinstall/index.html), or follow [instructions for windows and linux here](https://github.com/antha-lang/antha). Installing natively will ultimately be more flexible but will require more configuration steps.

### Basics of golang
1. Antha is a domain specific progrmaming language for biology built atop the [go](golang.org) programming language. Many of the core concepts in go also apply in Antha so if you're not familiar with the concepts of programming we highly recommend checking out chapters 1 to 9 of the [golang book](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/1).

For lesson 1 you will need to go through the material in chapters 1-4:

a. Getting started  

b. Reading a go program 

c. Types 

d. Variables 


For lesson 2 and 3 you will need to go through the material in chapters 5-9:

e. For/If/Switch 

f. Arrays/slices/maps 

g. Functions 

h. Pointers

i. Structs/interfaces/methods 


For other basic resources on how to use the command line and git see [here](https://synthace.github.io/antha-lang-archive/docs/academy/basics.html)


### Using the command line
You will need to use the command line to run antha.
If using OS X or Linux and you’re not familiar with working on the command line, this tour offers a good introduction for navigating through the command line in unix/linux:

### Git and software project management
Git is a useful tool for collaborative software development projects and offers a great way to deal with managing code merges and version control.
Since antha is still in rapid development and we’re making changes on a weekly basis, you’ll need to use git for keeping up-to-date.

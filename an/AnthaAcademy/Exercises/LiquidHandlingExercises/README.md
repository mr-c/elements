## Exercises: Writing protocols

### Pre-requisites
- Lesson 1 of the Antha Academy
- golang book chapters 5-9

## Making a new element
A new template antha element and corresponding execution bundle can be generated by running the ```antharun new element``` command.

The protocol name is case sensitive and the first letter must be upper case. 

To make an new element called SplitSample we'd run the following command:

```bash
antharun new element SplitSample
```

A folder will be created containing two output files:

The Antha element should look like this:

```go 
// Protocol SplitSample performs something.
//
// All of this text should be used to describe what this protocol does.  It
// should begin with a one sentence summary begining with "Protocol X...". If
// neccessary, a empty line with a detailed description can follow (like this
// description does).
//
// Spend some time thinking of a good protocol name as this is the name by
// which this protocol will be referred. It should convey the purpose and scope
// of the protocol to an outsider and should suggest an obvious
// parameterization. 
//
// Protocol names are also case-sensitive, so try to use a consistent casing
// scheme.
//
// Examples of bad names:
//   - MyProtocol
//   - GeneAssembly
//   - WildCAPSsmallANDLARGE
//
// Better names:
//   - Aliquot
//   - TypeIIsConstructAssembly
protocol SplitSample

// Place golang packages to import here
import (
	"github.com/antha-lang/antha/antha/anthalib/wtype"
	"github.com/antha-lang/antha/antha/anthalib/mixer"
)

// Parameters to this protocol
Parameters (
	A float64
	B float64
	Option bool
	String string
	StringArray []string
	VolumeA wunit.Volume
	VolumeB wunit.Volume
)

// Output data of this protocol
Data (
	Sum float64
)

// Physical inputs to this protocol
Inputs (
	ComponentA *wtype.LHComponent
	ComponentB *wtype.LHComponent
)

// Physical outputs to this protocol
Outputs (
	MixedComponent *wtype.LHComponent
)

// Conditions to run on startup
Setup {

}

// The core process for this protocol. These steps are executed for each input.
Steps {
	Sum = A + B
	sampleA := mixer.Sample(ComponentA, VolumeA)
	sampleB := mixer.Sample(ComponentB, VolumeB)
	MixedComponent = Mix(sampleA, sampleB)
}

// Run after controls and a steps block are completed to post process any data
// and provide downstream results
Analysis {

}

// A block of tests to perform to validate that the sample was processed
// correctly. Optionally, destructive tests can be performed to validate
// results on a dipstick basis
Validation {

}

```

The Bundle file should look like this:

```json
{
  "processes": {
    "Process1": {
      "component": "SplitSample"
    }
  },
  "connections": null,
  "parameters": {
    "Process1": {
      "A": 2.99,
      "B": -1,
      "ComponentA": "water",
      "ComponentB": "water",
      "Option": false,
      "String": "Example",
      "StringArray": [
        "A",
        "B",
        "C"
      ],
      "VolumeA": "1ul",
      "VolumeB": "2ul"
    }
  },
  "config": null
}
```

### Important!
To use anthabuild to compile the antha file the an file will need to be within the antha-lang/elements/an folder. 

## Excercises

1. Using what you've learnt in Lesson 1, adapt the protocol to Split an input solution into two output solutions. 

The Parameters should look like this:

```go
VolumeA Volume
VolumeB Volume
```

The inputs:

```go
InputSolution *wtype.LHComponent
```


The outputs: 

```go
SolutionA *wtype.LHComponent
SolutionB *wtype.LHComponent
```

2. Generate a protocol called CherryPick which will take in a slice of components as an input and output a single component.
No Mixing will take place unless the MixToNewLocation parameter is set to true. 

The Parameters should look like this:

```go
PositionInSlice int
MixToNewLocation bool
```

The inputs:

```go
InputSolutions []*wtype.LHComponent
```


The outputs: 

```go
OutputSolution *wtype.LHComponent
```

3. Modify CherryPick into a protocol called CherryPickSlice to take in a slice of positions to CherryPick

The Parameters should look like this:

```go
PositionsInSlice []int
MixToNewLocation bool
```

The inputs:

```go
InputSolutions []*wtype.LHComponent
```


The outputs: 

```go
OutputSolutions []*wtype.LHComponent
```

4. Make a new protocol based around the [Transfer](https://github.com/antha-lang/elements/blob/master/an/Liquid_handling/Transfer/Transfer.an) protocol which will take in a slice of solutions and transfer them to a specified plate

The Parameters should look like this:

```go
TransferVolume Volume
Replicates int
```

The inputs:

```go
InputSolutions []*wtype.LHComponent
OutPlate *wtype.LHPlate
```


The outputs: 

```go
OutPutSolutions []*wtype.LHComponent
OutputSolutionsMap map[string][]*wtype.LHComponent // as a potentially more convenient output we can also return a map of the solutions using the name of the component as a key
```

5. Make a new protocol called Dilute which will automatically dilute a sample to an intermediate dilution plate and then transfer the diluted Sample into the OutPlate if SampleVolume is below a minimal threshold.
Return a warning back to the user if a dilution has occurred. 

Do this by writing a new function in the protocol which will call the [SerialDilution](https://github.com/antha-lang/elements/blob/master/an/Liquid_handling/SerialDilution/SerialDilution.an) element if the TargetTransferVolume.SIValue() < MinimalTransferVolume.SIValue()

The Parameters should look like this:

```go
TargetTransferVolume Volume
MinimalTransferVolume Volume
DilutionFactor int
```

The inputs:

```go
TransferSample *wtype.LHComponent
Diluent *wtype.LHComponent
DilutionPlate *wtype.LHPlate
OutPlate *wtype.LHPlate
```


The data outputs:

```go
Warning error
Diluted bool
```

The outputs: 

```go
FinalSolution *wtype.LHComponent
IntermediateSolution *wtype.LHComponent
```


5. Make a new protocol called Aliquot_multi based around the [Aliquot](https://github.com/antha-lang/elements/blob/master/starter/Aliquot/Aliquot.an) protocol which will take in a slice of solutions and Aliquot them all

Do this by recursively using the Aliquot element from within the Aliquot_multi element in a similar way to the AutoPCR_demo element shown in Lesson0.

The Parameters should look like this:

```go
SolutionToVolumeMap map[string]Volume
SolutionToReplicatesMap map[string]int
```

The inputs:

```go
InputSolutions []*wtype.LHComponent
```


The outputs: 

```go
OutputSolutionsMap map[string][]*wtype.LHComponent // as a potentially more convenient output we can also return a map of the solutions using the name of the component as a key
```
